# EstateApp-with-CSharp

This is my first project I used OOP. I coded the basic real estate automation with C#. I tried to use clean code techniques. I saved the house information with C# FileStream in a TXT file. I tried to code the simple automation without a database and did the necessary checks to minimize errors.
